\section{Further Work}
While the article's claims that were seen as essential have been verified \cite{DPLCpaper}, there are some details in the article that have been omitted that should be considered for the development of a working system.
\paragraph{Aggregation and fragmentation} Once the possibility to maximize the PRR has been established it becomes pertinent to utilize the varying packet length in the upper layers. Once again the article proposes a system of defragmentation where data packets are split into smaller packets at the source and aggregation where packets are gathered into larger packets according to the state of the channel \cite{DPLCpaper}. At the receiving node it would likewise be necessary to implement deaggregation and reassembling.
\paragraph {In this paper} the choice was made not to implement support for \textbf{multi-hop} and for \textbf{two-way commmunication}. The former is described in \cite{DPLCpaper}. In general all communication with the upper layers has not received attention and thus the development of an easy-to-understand API would be relevant.
